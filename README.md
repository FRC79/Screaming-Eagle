### Speed Controller Calibration
Victors or Talons may be used as speed controllers. Though they should work out-of-the-box, you can use the `speed_controller_calibration.ino` program in the [Arduino programming environment](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) to calibrate them along with their corresponding datasheets for references to the calibration process. Follow the instructions in the calibration program.

### Driver Station
For the joystick control libraries, download [procontroll.zip](http://creativecomputing.cc/p5libs/procontroll/procontroll.zip) , extract the folder, and move it to the libraries directory of your Processing folder.
